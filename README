How to Play
- Press the buttons to get three X marks in a row before the opponent gets three O marks!
- Horizontal, vertical, and diagonal 3-in-a-row marks are valid.
- The game ends in a draw if all buttons are marked and there are no 3-in-a-rows :(
- Press the reset button at any time to clear the grid.

Goals
- to practice and improve my programming
- to create a simple game
- to distract myself from bad cramps (this is how the project started, true story)

Serious Stuff
- I do not claim Tic Tac Toe as my original idea.
- Thus far, I am the sole contributor to the project.
- This app and its future forms will remain free and open source.
