    <string name="about_text">You are X. Place three X\'s such that they are adjacent to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before the opponent O does first.\n\nI do not claim credit for coming up with this game (Wikipedia traces the game\'s origins to the Roman Empire), but I did write the code and doodle out the art.
